We will end with a dialogue connecting immigration and ethnicity in the American context to larger macro-theories of globalization, i.e. the production of the global citizen-consumer. The overall aim of this course is to provide an overview of the ways Asian Americans define, reify, and contest belonging and not belonging in ways that hopefully shape our own sense of place in the contemporary political and social moment.\n", "\nGrounded in intersectionality, this introductory course examines the axes of identities that shape lived experiences of people of color -- Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans and Latinx Americans -- in the United States. Drawing from a range of interdisciplinary texts, students will critically reflect on the ways power operates in the production of inequalities that are then reproduced, resisted, and transformed through discourses of migration, labor, culture, and belonging.Satisfies GE Category F.\n", "\nStudents will analyze the political roles, daily experiences, labor, and artistic outlets of women of color in the United States from a wide variety of racial backgrounds. They will engage with academic sources, literary fiction, as well as other forms of media including film, music, art, and podcasts to examine the cultural and political significance of the category \"women of color\" and it particular salience in our contemporary moment.\n", "\nSemester Prerequisite:  ES 1000Development and implementation of research (quantitative or qualitative) that explores in depth one or more facets of ethnic experience. Formerly offered as ES 300.\n", "\nThis course uses popular culture as a medium through which to analyze representations and performances of race, gender, and sexuality as well as their intersections in film, music, podcasts, art, literature, and poetry. Through these confrontations, students will question the rewards as well as the limits of the politics of representation and apply their understandings to course assignments and projects that involve direct engagement with their world and worldviews.\n", "\nThis course is an exploration of transnational Black Feminist Movements in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. The focus will be, broadly speaking, on how literatures, theories and coalitional movements created by those who identify as Black women speak to longstanding struggles on social justice and liberation.\n", "\nThis course is an exploration of queer of color critique, an interdisciplinary field that recognizes the always-present intersections between race, gender, and sexuality. Moreover, it is an investigation into the ways in which Ethnic Studies has, in its framework, always already have been queer, always already have queered.\n", "\nThis course explores the history of immigration and migration in the United States through the lens of race and ethnicity. Additional themes include citizenship, law, nationalism, violence, gender, sexuality, labor, and globalization. Offered as ES 3201 and HIST 3201, students may not receive credit for both.\n", "\nThis course is an exploration of Black Studies, providing both a historical and cultural overview, as well as an examination of how this interdisciplinary field has shaped numerous conversations on race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, class and nation, both within the United States and in a broader, transnational context.\n", "\nSituating migrant women's experiences at the center of this course, students will explore the ways the transnational realities of gendered labor position migrant women precariously in relation to the market and the state. This course examines various formal and informal sectors of work including domestic work, sex work, child care, nursing, and other forms of service work to understand the ways migrant women are uniquely racialized and feminized to position them paradoxically within and outside imaginings of US belonging.\n", "\nMulticulturalism and diversity have become tokenized liberal discourses of immigrant assimilation in the West. This course examines how these ideologies emerged as well as the ways people reproduce and contest these discourses by occupying registers of exclusion and inclusion simultaneously. We will examine these experiences through historical accounts, ethnography, and media representations to develop a critical understanding of the ways these narratives get \"lived\" in the contemporary context.\n", "\nThis course utilizes documentary and popular film to better understand the experiences, representation, and resistance modes of people of color in the US. Students will explore racist imagery central to the American film industry during the 20th century while deeply analyzing film as a vital facet of political resistance and artistic production among people of color. Offered as ES 3630 and HIST 3630, students may not receive credit for both.\n", "\nA selected area or issue of ethnic studies. May be repeated for credit as topics change. Formerly known as ES 394.\n", "\nThis course posits that medicine, race and the fight for healthcare among people of color are deeply intertwined within the study of racial justice and oppression in the United States. Students will analyze portrayals of public health crises, the effects of environmental racism, and the long tradition of healthcare-centered activism among people of color in the US.\n", "\nThis course chronicles social movements in the US from the 1840s to the present, with a focus on race and ethnicity as centerpieces of grassroots organizing. Students will utilize sources from history, sociology, psychology, and literature to better grasp common threads, successes, and limitations of social movements. The class will begin with anti-slavery organizing during the mid-1800s and will end with a focus on movements such as Black Lives Matter, climate change activism, and immigration reform.\n", "\nThis course analyzes US history and empire-building with a focus on the 20th century. Students explore the ways in which race, gender, and the growth of capitalism are inherently intertwined within this process. Content will trace the history of American occupations and economic and military interventions throughout numerous regions of the globe. Offered as ES 4200 and HIST 4200, students may not receive credit for both.\n", "\nThis course merges the broader study of Latinx history (1920-the present) with detailed documentary and popular film analyses. Students will analyze Latinx-produced films alongside changing portrayals of Latinx populations on film throughout the twentieth century.\n", "\nThis course looks at the ways transnational feminisms and a global racial framework inform and expand our understanding of race and gender within and outside of the US. We will look at women's activism, labor organizing, migration, social movements, and development discourse to open up possibilities for imagining a global, transnational commitment to social justice and reflect on practices that can help create such visions.\n", "\nThis course is an exploration of Southern California as sites where Ethnic Studies is practiced and lived within various cities and communities. While the birth of Ethnic Studies has historically been linked to Northern California, this course will utilize Ethnic Studies as a means of exploring immigration, settler colonialism and environmental justice, among other topics, in and around Los Angeles, San Diego and the Inland Empire.\n", "\nThis course, an homage to bell hooks, draws from interdisciplinary texts to examine consumer culture through the lens of race, gender, and class. Contemporary debates surrounding the links and ruptures between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation have become nearly ubiquitous on university campuses and in various media outlets. Instead of resolving these concerns, this course examines the discourses that have given rise to these debates centering on consumption and the forms of racialization certain types of consumption produce. We will examine how these ideas have been contested by communities of color in the US as they negotiate their place in a racial landscape that perpetually inscribes them as the other.\n", "\nSemester Prerequisite:  Students must have taken at least one other upper-division Ethnic Studies course in order to enroll in an ES 5000-level courses (or have received faculty approval)This course explores how one might utilize Ethnic Studies as a pedagogical tool and framework within the classroom and other spaces of learning.

It will also examine the ways in which performance, both onstage and off, holds the potential to disrupt conventional and/or stereotypical ways of thinking about identities.\n", "\nSemester Prerequisite:  Students must have taken at least one other upper-division Ethnic Studies course in order to enroll in ES 5000-level courses (or have received faculty approval)Reflecting the ongoing indebtedness of Ethnic Studies to learning with and learning from those outside of traditional spaces of higher education, this internship course provides an opportunity for service learning and community engagement. Community partners will be selected in consultation with Ethnic Studies faculty. Regular meetings with supervising faculty member will be required.\n", "\nSemester Prerequisite:  Completed and passed a minimum of one (1) upper-division Ethnic Studies course or faculty consultationThis course is an Ethnic Studies methodologies seminar wherein students will pursue faculty-guided independent research projects.
